IRMa stands for **Interactive Restaurant Menu** (the a is to make it pronouncable) and is an answer to dull webpages serving as stiff menus everywhere. It's also an app where I learn Blazor WebAssembly ;-)

To run application write this into the command line (from the project folder Irma):

> dotnet run

You can use it for your own use.
